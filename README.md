# Reseachtools
Based on Mr Kurt Schwehr's  excellent Research Tools course from UNH.
https://github.com/schwehr?tab=repositories

The original course is here with mercurial. http://vislab-ccom.unh.edu/~schwehr/rt/  Mr Schwehr states "I am releasing all course material under a creative commons non-commercial license..." so I'll be doing the same.
